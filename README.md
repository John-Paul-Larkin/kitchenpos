# <a href="https://kitchenpos.netlify.app/">Restaurant Point of sale App</a>

### Overview

hosted on netlify

Kitchen POS is a point of sale application for restaurants, designed to simplify the process of order taking, while streamlining communication between the server in the front of house, and the chefs in the kitchen. I built this app to work  to work in conjunction with a kitchen display app.

#### How to use
First open the <a href="https://kitchenpos.netlify.app/">POS app</a>, select a table and add some orders. Optionally  you can customise the order with extra ingredients before sending them through to the kitchen.
Following this you can open the <a href="https://kitchenpos.netlify.app/">kitchen display app</a>, where you can view all orders along a timeline.
